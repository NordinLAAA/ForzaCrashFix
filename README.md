# ForzaCrashFix
Forza keep crashing 10-15minutes into the game? Use this batch file to fix your issues!

This batch file consist of the following options:
1. End Forza and Load Explorer
2. Start Task Manager
3. Stop explorer.exe (To continue with Forza so it doesn't crash)
4. Load back explorer.exe

The reason why I added these is because stopping explorer.exe seems to fix most issues about the crashes 10-15minutes loading into the game.

This Batch file will make your lives easier then opening a task manager non-stop just to start and stop explorer.exe

Feel free to edit the text as I'm just doing this because I am tired of doing the task manager steps (#Easier)
